"""The format a recording is in, the level meter, and the WAV writer.

None of this is platform work: signed 16-bit little-endian at 16 kHz is what
whisper wants wherever it runs, and the arithmetic over it is the same on every
desktop. It lives below the adapters so that both of them can measure a block
the same way, and so audio.py can go on offering these names unchanged.
